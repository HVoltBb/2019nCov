# COVD-19
Data analysis of 2019 novel coronavirus COVD-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China

Three datasets are included here.
1. The international exported cases based on Wu(2020) with updated dates when the patient left Wuhan. Cases that are due to human-to-human infection are exluded.
2. The evacuee dataset. Evacuated individuals from Jan. 29 to Feb. 2, 2020 are included in the analysis. These individuals provide a snapshot status of the infection status in Wuhan.
3. The real time daily heat index into/out of Wuhan during chunyun based on Baidu Migration (Baidu Tianyan in Chinese). The converstion factor was found to be 138,412.0099 based on OTG calibrated historical Tencent mobility data.

These datasets can be found in the Data folder. Note that although the median incubation period for this disease is very short, periods as long as 24 days has been observed. There are several more planed evacuations in the near future. The infection status of these individuals will provide more information on the current status of the outbreak and the efficiency of the mitigation in place.

Datesets #1 and #2 will be updated weekly when new information is available, and **updates and corrections from you are also welcome**. 

You are also welcome to suggest other forms of data to aid the analysis.
