# COVD-19
Data analysis of 2019 novel coronavirus COVD-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China

Three datasets are included here.
1. The international exported cases based on [Wu(2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30260-9) with updated dates when the patient left Wuhan. Cases that are due to human-to-human infection are exluded.
2. The evacuee dataset. Evacuated individuals from Jan. 29 to Feb. 2, 2020 are included in the analysis. These individuals provide snapshot views of the infection status in Wuhan.
3. The real time daily heat index into/out of Wuhan during chunyun based on Baidu Migration (Baidu Tianyan in Chinese). The converstion factor was found to be 138,412.0099 based on OTG calibrated historical Tencent mobility data.

These datasets can be found in the [Data](https://github.com/HVoltBb/2019nCov/blob/master/data/) subfolder. There are additional planed evacuations in the near future. The infection status of these individuals will provide more information on the current status of the outbreak and the efficiency of the mitigation in place.

Datesets #1 and #2 will be updated when new information becomes available.

**This is a work in progress, updates and corrections from you are also welcome**. 

For those with a sensored connection, the datasets are also made available through figshare with links listed below:
1. [Exported cases](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11859198.v1)
2. [Evacuee dataset](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11859207.v1)
3. [Real time traffic](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11859210.v1)

The versions on figshare will be updated sporadically following the versions here. For those who can view this text, you can forget about figshare and just use the files in the [Data](https://github.com/HVoltBb/2019nCov/blob/master/data/) subfolder. 

You are also welcome to suggest other data sources to aid the analysis.
